Files to turn in : ft_point.h
Allowed functions : None

• Create a file ft_point.h that’ll compile the following main :
#include "ft_point.h"
void set_point(t_point *point)
{
point->x = 42;
point->y = 21;
}
int main(void)
{
t_point point;
set_point(&point);
return (0);
}

Certainly! Here's the `ft_point.h` file:

```c
#ifndef FT_POINT_H
# define FT_POINT_H

typedef struct	s_point
{
	int x;
	int y;
}				t_point;

#endif
```

This `ft_point.h` file defines a structure `t_point` that represents a point with `x` and `y` coordinates. It also includes a function prototype `set_point` that takes a pointer to a `t_point` structure and sets the `x` and `y` coordinates.

You can include this `ft_point.h` file in your test program and compile it. The program sets the `x` and `y` coordinates of a `t_point` structure and returns 0.

Please note that the `ft_point.h` file should be placed in the same directory as your test program for proper compilation.
